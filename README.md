**Design of Experiments (DOE)** is a systematic approach used in statistics to plan, conduct, analyze, and interpret controlled tests. It helps in understanding how different factors influence a response variable, allowing researchers and practitioners to optimize processes and improve outcomes.

This repository contents some demonstrattion notebooks on how to use Design of Experiment in *Python* and how to analyse the results.

Two of three datasets in this repository were extracted from [Design and Analysis of Experiments, 10th Edition by Douglas C. Montgomery](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design+and+Analysis+of+Experiments%2C+10th+Edition-p-9781119492443)
